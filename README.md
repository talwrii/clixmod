# clixmod

**Status: Basic functionality in the process of being implemented. Author has used the for real work**

Modify XML and HTML documents using [XPATHs](https://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116/) from the command line.
Analogous to `s//` in the command-line tool sed.
A companion utility to [clixpath](https://github.com/talwrii/clixpath).

Requires [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) but can co-exist with Python2.

# See also and flagrant advertising

* [clixpath](https://github.com/talwrii/clixpath) is a tool by the author to *extract* information from XML and HTML documents.

# Motivation

* Hopefully easier to use than XSLT
* Delete element from HTML
* Change element types
* Remove attributes
* Empty the contents of elements into their parents

# Examples

```sh
# Replace all h2 elements with h1 elements
clixmod //h2 '<h1>{content}</h1>'

# Delete h2 elements
clixmod //h2 ''

# Turn all level-2 headers to level-1 headers
# clixmod //h2 children=descendant::* '<h1>{children}</h1>' # Not implemented

# Not implemented
# Show all the class attributes
# clixmod -f //@class  # Not implemented

# Delete all the class attributes
# clixmod //@class '' # Not implemented
```

# Installing

```
pip install git+https://github.com/talwrii/clixmod#egg=clixmod
```


# Usage

```
usage: clixmod [-h] [--filter]
               XPATH [selection_xpath [selection_xpath ...]] replacement

Modify xml or html documents

positional arguments:
  XPATH            XPATH to modify
  selection_xpath  relative XPATH to select. Use name=XPATH for named groups
  replacement      XML to replace XPATH with. {} for entire match, {1}... for
                   selection XPATHs

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --filter, -f     Show matches rather than output text

```

# Alternatives and prior work

* This tool is in many ways nothing more than a convenience wrapper around the [lxml](http://lxml.de/) library (though this tool will be greatly easier to use for its uses cases)
* [XSLT](https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt/) is a [w3c](https://www.w3.org/) language for transforming XML.
